# PRACTICE TIDYING DATA


# KEY STEP:
# before you type the code, write down what you think 
# the tidy data structure should look like

# load required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(rcis)


# 1. TIDY THE `RACE SCORES` DATA
# race scores of 4 individuals
# columns are different times, cell values are scores

# check
race

# tidy this data (hint: requires pivot_longer)




# 2. TIDY THE `GRADES` DATA
# grades of different individuals in two tests (math, writing)
# measured at different points in time (quarter, year)

# check
grades

# tidy this data (hint: requires pivot_longer and pivot_wider)




# 3. TIDY THE `ACTIVITIES` DATA
# different activities (work, play, talk) at two points in time
# performed by individuals in a treatment or control group

# check
activities

# tidy this data (hint: requires multiple transformations)
